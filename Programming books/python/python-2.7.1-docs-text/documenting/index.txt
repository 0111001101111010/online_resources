Documenting Python
******************

The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much of
it contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python
documentation is reStructuredText, developed by the docutils project,
amended by custom directives and using a toolset named Sphinx to
postprocess the HTML output.

This document describes the style guide for our documentation as well
as the custom reStructuredText markup introduced by Sphinx to support
Python documentation and how it should be used.

Note: If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
  there's no need to write reStructuredText if you're not so inclined;
  plain text contributions are more than welcome as well.  Send an
  e-mail to docs@python.org or open an issue on the *tracker*.
