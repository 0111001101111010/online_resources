Overview:
- object-based.
- ECMAScript Object is a collection of properties each with zero or more
  attributes that determine how each property can be used.
- Properties are containers that hold other objects, primitive values or
  functions.
- Primitive Value --> Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String.
- Object --> built-in object, function
- method --> a function that is associated with an object via a property
- Built-in objects --> Object object, Function object, Array object, String
  object, Boolean object, Number object, Math object, Date object, RegExp
  object, JSON object, Error, EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError,
  SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError
- operators --> unary, multiplicative, additive, bitwise shift, relational,
  equality, binary bitwise, binary logical, assignment, comma

 Objects:
 - created via constructors. (create and executes the initialization code)
 - Each constructor has a property named "prototype" for prototype-based
   inheritance and shared properties.
 - Every object created by a constructor has a reference to its constructor's
   prototype.
 - A prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype and so
   on; this is called prototype chain.
 - A reference to a property of an object is to the property of that name in 
   the first object in the prototype chain that contains a property of that name.
