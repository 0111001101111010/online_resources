General Purpose Registers: (used to assign any value) - 16 bits
AX - accumulator register (used for doing arithmetic operations)
BX - base register (used for array operations)
CX - counter register (counter purposes, looping)
DX - data register (reserving data value)

Segment Registers:
CS - code segment register (pointer to segment of running program)
DS - data segment register (pointer to segment of data used by the running program)
ES - extra segment register (used with DI and doing pointer things)
DS:SI, ES:DI - commonly used to do string operations
SS - stack segment register (points to stack segment)

Index Registers: (process arrays of strings)
SI -  source index (points to the source array)
DI - destination index (points to destination array)
- used to move a block of data such as records(or structures) and arrays. commonly coupled with DS and ES.

Pointer Registers:
BP - base pointer (used for preserving space to use local variables)
SP - stack pointer (used to point the current stack)
IP - instruction pointer (current pointer of the running program. cannot be modified. coupled with CS)
CS:IP - pointer pointing to the current instruction of running program. (cannot access CS nor IP directly)

flag register:
- used to store the current status of the processor.

 -------------------------------
    IOPL

C - carry flag (bit 0). Turned to 1 when last arithmetical operation such as adding and subtracting has carry or borrow.
P - denotes parity flag (bit 2). Rarely used. Will set to 1 if last opration (any operation) results even number of bit 1.
A - auxiliary flag or adjust flag (bit 4). Set in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations.
Z - zero flag (bit 6). Used to detect whether last operation hold zero result.
S - sign flag (bit 7). Used to detect whether the last operation holds -ve result.
T - trap flag (bit 8). Used in debuggers to turn on step-by-step feature.
I - interrupt flag (bit 9). Used to toggle the interrupt enable or not.
D - direction flag (bit 10). Used for directions of string operations. If set, string operations done backword else forward.
O - overflow flag (bit 11). Detect whether last arithmetic operation has overflowed or not. If set, overflow.
IOPL - I/O Privilege level flag (bit 12 to 13). Denote the privilege level of running programs.
N - Nested Task flag (bit 14). Used to detect whether it has been multiple task occur.

O, D, I, S, Z and C - most commonly used flags

AX:
 + AH - high 8 bit of AX (0-7 bits)
 + AL - low 8 bit of AX (8-15 bits)

Extended Registers: - 32 bits
EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
AX is the lower 16 bits of EAX.
BX is the lower 16 bits of EBX.
CX is the lower 16 bits of ECX.
DX is the lower 16 bits of EDX.
